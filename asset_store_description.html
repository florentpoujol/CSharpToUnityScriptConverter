The conversion of scripts from a language to another as always been a very long and tedious task ... until now. <br>
This extension provides you with the best solution to efficiently translate C# code into UnityScript code while drinking your coffee (if you are fast enough).
<br>
<br>
Main features :
<br>
- <strong>very thorough and intelligent</strong> conversion (it's just the best converter out there)
<br>
- <strong>mass conversion</strong> : from one file to whole hierarchies
<br>
- <strong>ultra fast</strong> : 300+ lines/second (you just can't compete...)
<br>
- <strong>dead-easy setup and use</strong> : drop files in a folder, hit a button, and it's done before you had time to finish your coffee !<br>

<br>
Please note that since UnityScript does not supports all features that C# provides, the conversion just can't be perfect in some cases.<br>
Read the manual to learn more about these features. <br>
