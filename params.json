{"body":"#What does it do ?\r\n\r\nThis extension for Unity3D does a damn good at converting C# scripts into UnityScript scripts.\r\nMore precisely, the extension provides a very good quality mass-conversion solution to translate C# code into UnityScript.\r\n\r\nCurrent version : 1.0\r\nLast edit of this manual on the 30th of November 2012.\r\n\r\n#How to install\r\n\r\nExtract the CSharpToUnityScriptConverter.unitypackage in your Asset folder.\r\nIt will have created the \"Assets/CSharpToUnityScript\" folder.\r\n\r\nOpen the extension via the menu \"Script Converters > C# To UnityScript\".\r\n\r\n#How to use\r\n\r\nThe extension will convert any C# scripts found in the \"source\" directory and create their UnityScript conterpart in the \"target\" directory.\r\n\r\nBy default, the source directory is \"Assets/CSharpToUnityScript/Source\" and the target directory will be \"Assets/CSharpToUnityScript/ConvertedScripts\". You may change these paths via the appropriate fields.\r\n\r\nPut the C# scripts in your source directory then hit the \"convert\" button.\r\nThe extension tab shows you how many files are left to be converted.\r\nThe console display the name of the files when their conversion is completed.\r\n\r\nIf you have many files being converted and want to abord the conversion, just hit the \"Abord\" button.\r\nThis won't stops the conversion of the current file but it won't convert any more file after that.\r\nIf you hit the convert button again, it will convert again the whole source directory.\r\n\r\nThe conversion speed is about 10Ko or a couple hundreds of lines per second.\r\n\r\n#Options","note":"Don't delete this file!
